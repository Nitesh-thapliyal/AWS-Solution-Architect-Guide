 <summary> EC2 </summary>
<hr>

## Before we start with EC2 lets discuss a basic:

-  If we want to run any program, we need OS and in order to perform any task on OS we need Memory / CPU and Storage. The OS which has Basically Memory / CPU and Storage is called System but in AWS these are called Instances, So

### What are Instance?
- Virtual Computing Environment is Known as Instance. 


## Features of EC2: 
<hr>

### 1. Amazon Machine Images(AMI):

-  Pre configured Templates for your instances is known as Amazon Machine Image(AMI) 

### 2. Instance Type: 
-  Various Configuration of CPU, memory , storage and networking capacity for your indtances is known as Istance type. 

### 3. Key pairs:

- Secure login information for your instance, AWS stores the public key and you store the private key in secure place. 

### 4. Amazon EBS Volume:
- Persistent storage volume for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store 

### 5. Instance Store Volume:
- Storage Volume for temporary data that's deleted when you stop, hibernate or terminate your instance.

### 6. Security Group:
- A firewall that enables you to specify the protocol, ports and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using security group.

### 7. Elastic IP:
- Static IPV4 Address for dynamic cloud computing, known as Elastic IP addresses.

### 8. EC2 Resources:
- Metadata, known as tags, that you can create and assign to your EC2 resources.

### 9. Region and Availability Zone:
- Multiple physical locations for uoir resources such as Instance and Amazon EBS Volume known as Regions  and Availability Zone.

### 10. Virtual Private Cloud(VPC):
-  Virtual  Networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS cloud, and that can optionally connect to your own Network, known as VPC.

 <summary> Security Group </summary>

## What is Security Group?
- A security group acts as virtual firewall for your EC2 instance to control incomming and outgoing trafffic.

```

- Private key does not support in Remote window but Private key is gateway to the window password

- Window gives encrypted password, we need to decrypt the password using private key

- If we want anyone from outside world to connect through network is by using the **Port number**

- Thre traffic comming from outside the network is called **Ingress** or **Inbound traffic**

### Note

- If somebody know IP and Port number, they can connect to our OS, but if we don't want them to connect, we need to **restrict** them

- To restrict,  we need to put security **outside** the OS

- Before they hit the IP, they are restricted, for that we need to provide **Security**

- The Security in AWS is managed by **Security Group** and for providing the scurity we need ti provide **list** of who can connect

- This list contains the rule like **SSH Port 22**, we can give source IP

- After setting the rules only selected public IP will be allowed to connect

> If we want to provision instance we need to provide Security Group, it is compulsory

```

    User --> PrivateIP
    User --> PublicIP
```
- OS never know about Public IP, but it is there
- **Public IP** are only available when we are using Internet

- Internally they are uisng Public IP to connect **(Natting)** because over Internet private IP won't work

### Natting

- **Network Address Translation(NAT)** is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packet while they are in transit accross the traffic routing device

 <summary> Storage </summary>
<hr>

### What is Storage?

- Storage is one kind of device use for storing data permanent(Persistent)

- Storage is divided into three parts depending upon what kind of data you want to store

- If the kind of data changes then the type of store changes

### Types of Storage:

1. **Object Storage**
2. **Block Storage**
3. **File Storage**


**Object Storage** :

- To store the data peristent and if we don't want to install the OS then we use Object Storage. Example - Google Drive, DropBox

In *AWS* we have a service that provides *Object Storage As A Service* and the name of that service is **S3(Simple Storage Service)** 

**Block Storage** : 

- Any storage device which is required to install the OS is known as Block Storage. Example- Hard Disk

- In *AWS* we have a service that provide **Block Storage AS a Service** is **EBS(Elastic Block Store)**

- EBS is a sub service of EC2


**File Storage**:

- [Comming Soon]

### Note 
- In AWS if we want to install any OS for that we require template which is called AMI and it is installed in **Block Device**

- In AWS there are 3 types of Block device

### Types of Block Device

1. **Root Block Device**
2. **Empherial Block Device**
3. **Elastic Block Store**


**Root Block Device**
- The only way to install os is by using thre Root Block storage

**EBS** : 
- It's like an external storage which we can attach and deattach and os can be install in it.

**Empheral Storage Device**
- [Comming Soon]
